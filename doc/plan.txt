# Functionality
    - download fastq data from ENCODE
    - map to genome (BAM)
        - map to genome with RNA-Star (and identify new exons)
        - identify novel junctions (JunctionSeq)
        - merge discovered junctions and create reference GTF
            - automatic with merge_??? from tophat
            - manually check intermediate output of DEXSeq,
              check if exons binned correctly and fix problematic ones)
        - remap all using new GTF
    - identification of differential exon usage (DEXSeq, csv)

    - merge DEXseq results into summary files
        - tables with counts
        - tables with differential expression


# Update loop
    1. scan for new RNA-Seq data in encode
        if new, send email
        else return to 1
    2. process new data:
        - map and discover new junctions and merge with current GTF
        - show changes in exon binning by DEXSeq
    3. user manually checks novel junctions and correctness of DEXSeq binning,
       updates GTF and DEXSeq binning if needed
    4. if GTF changes then:
        - store new version of GTF and DEXSeq binning
        - remap all data to genome using updated GTF
        - rerun DEXSeq for differential exon usage
        - update summary files
    return to 1


# Architecture

Docker - queue, workers
    ENCODE API
    RNA-Star
    DEXSeq
    JunctionSeq

NFS
    data
        - inputs are FASTQ files
    genome
        - sequence and mapper index
    results
        - one folder for each "project" (project is reference genome +
          starting GTF on top of which we build refined GTFs)
        - each project has subfolders, one for each update, where refined
          GTF, bins and csv files are stored.
          It may contain a temporary folder with intermediate results
          (mapping, DEXSeq outputs), which we delete periodically.


# Software interfaces

RNA-Star
    - FASTQ + GTF -> BAM

JunctionSeq
    - BAM + GTF -> new GTF

DEXSeq, two functions:
    - GTF -> bins
    - bins + bam + pval threshold -> csv

merge GTF: tophat tool? check if ok

merge csv: script in Python
    - multiple csv -> merged csv

encode
    - API to encode site
    - called regularly to check for new RNA-Seq data and send email

queue.py
    - feeds workers with job requests

01_check_encode.py
02_map_discover.py
03_report_diffs.py
04_summarize.py
