# Functionality
    - download fastq data from ENCODE
    - map to genome (BAM)
        - map to genome with RNA-Star (and identify new exons)
        - identify novel junctions (JunctionSeq)
        - merge discovered junctions and create reference GTF
            - automatic with merge_??? from tophat
            - manually check intermediate output of DEXSeq,
              check if exons binned correctly and fix problematic ones)
        - remap all using new GTF
    - identification of differential exon usage (DEXSeq, csv)

    - merge DEXseq results into summary files
        - tables with counts
        - tables with differential expression


# Update loop
    1. scan for new RNA-Seq data in ENCODE and process, two queues are run in
       parallel:
            queue A: scan for new RNA-Seq data to download
                after fastq file is downloaded, add mapping task to queue B
            queue B: map and discover new junctions
                after mapping, add merge task to queue C
            queue C: merge new junctions into current GTF

       Send email notification whenever a queue becomes empty or non-empty.

       When all queues become empty (but were non-empty at last check):
            a) stop adding to queues
            b) compare current and latest GTF for changes
            c) if changed:
                d) RUN dexseq on current GTF to get binning
                e) compare current and latest binning
                f) if changed:
                    g) store


        if new:
            a) download all new RNA-Seq data
            b) notify by email that mapping started
            c) map and discover new junctions and merge with current GTF
            e) notify by email of new merged GTF and binned file
               attached changes in GTFs and exon binning
        else return to 1

    2. user manually checks novel junctions and correctness of DEXSeq binning,
       updates GTF and DEXSeq binning if needed
    3. if GTF or binning changed then:
        - store new version of GTF and DEXSeq binning
        - remap all data to genome using updated GTF
        - rerun DEXSeq for differential exon usage
        - update summary files
    return to 1


# Architecture

Docker - queue, workers
    ENCODE API
    RNA-Star
    DEXSeq
    JunctionSeq

NFS
    data
        - inputs are FASTQ files
    genome
        - sequence and mapper index
    results
        - one folder for each "project" (project is reference genome +
          starting GTF on top of which we build refined GTFs)
        - each project has subfolders, one for each update, where refined
          GTF, bins and csv files are stored.
          It may contain a temporary folder with intermediate results
          (mapping, DEXSeq outputs), which we delete periodically.


# Software interfaces

RNA-Star
    - FASTQ + GTF -> BAM

JunctionSeq
    - BAM + GTF -> new GTF

DEXSeq, two functions:
    - GTF -> bins
    - bins + bam + pval threshold -> csv

merge GTF: tophat tool? check if ok

merge csv: script in Python
    - multiple csv -> merged csv

encode
    - API to encode site
    - called regularly to check for new RNA-Seq data and send email

queue.py
    - feeds workers with job requests

worker.py

01_check_encode.py
02_map_discover.py
03_report_diffs.py
04_summarize.py
